# Computer Vision and Image Processing


#### Computer Vision
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs.  

 
#### Image Processing 
Image processing is the process of creating a new image from an existing image, typically simplifying or enhancing the content in some way.
Examples of image processing include:
1. Normalizing photometric properties of the image, such as brightness or color.
2. Cropping the bounds of the image, such as centering an object in a photograph.
3. Removing digital noise from an image, such as digital artifacts from low light levels.


#### Application of computer vision
Many popular computer vision applications involve:
1. Object Recognition
2. Object Classification
3. Object Identification
4. Object Landmark Detection
5. Object Segmentation
