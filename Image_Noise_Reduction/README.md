# Image Noise Reduction
Image noise reduction is the process of removing the noise from an Image. Addition of noise will create loss of information. The noise can be originated by many ways such as while capturing images in low-light situations, damage of electric circuits due to heat, sensor illumination levels of a digital camera or due to the faulty memory locations in hardware or bit errors in transmission of data over long distances.

The noise can be of various types like -
1. Impulse Noise (IN) where the pixel values are completely different from the surrounding pixel values.
   Impulse Nose is of two types: salt-and-pepper impulse noise (SPIN) and random valued impulse noise (RVIN).
2. Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), where each pixel in the image will be changed from its original value by a small amount.


#### Autoencoder
Auto-encoder is an algorithm to help reduce dimensionality of data with the help of neural networks. It can be used for lossy data compression where the compression is dependent on the given data. This algorithm to reduce dimensionality of data as learned from the data can also be used for reducing noise in data.


#### Project implementation and workflow
Following are the subtasks:
1. Importing Libraries 
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Adding Noise
4. Building and Training a Classifier
5. Building the Auto-encoder
6. Training the Auto-encoder
7. De-noised Images
