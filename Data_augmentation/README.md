# Data Augmentation

Training a machine learning model requires huge amount of data. Often collecting data in large amount is very difficult as requires a lot of time and cost.Data augmentation is often helpful to create more dataset of particular class for training the model. 

Following ways to augment data:
1. Rotation
2. Width and Height Shifts
3. Brightness
4. Shear transformation
5. Zoom
6. Channel Shift
7. Horizontal and Vertical Flips

Later Data normalization, rescaling and preprocessing are done. Then used in training model.
