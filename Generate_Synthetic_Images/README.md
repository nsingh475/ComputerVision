# Generate Synthetic Images
The process of generating any kind of data synthetically or artificially via programming is called Synthetic Data Generation. The data that can be used in these techniques can be images, text, audio, video, and so on. 


#### What is DCGAN
The deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is an extension of the GAN architecture for using deep convolutional neural networks for both the generator and discriminator models and configurations for the models and training that result in the stable training of a generator model.


#### Project implementation and workflow:
Following are the sub-tasks:
1. Importing libraries
2. Loading and preprocessing data
3. Creating batches of training data
4. Building generator network
5. Build discriminator network
6. Compile DCGAN
7. Training procedure
8. Train DCGAN
9. Generate synthetic images with DCGAN


In this project, I have built a DCGAN based synthetic image generator and a discriminator on the fashion-MNIST dataset.
